LocalPilot gives local and hosted models the loop they need to do useful
software work: inspect files, use tools, edit safely, run checks, recover from
bad output, and keep going across sessions. The core is provider-neutral and the
risky parts stay behind explicit permission boundaries.

| At a glance | |
|---|---|
| **Use it when** | You want a coding agent you can run against your own model or provider |
| **Connects to** | OpenAI-compatible local servers and supported official provider APIs |
| **Works as** | Interactive terminal agent, one-shot command, rule-enforced harness, RPC service, or ACP adapter |
| **Remembers through** | Embedded [LocalMind](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalMind), with review before durable memory |
| **Status** | `1.0.0` stable; public CLI, config, and provider contract follow SemVer |

## Quick start

You need Rust, Git, and a C compiler. Clone with the LocalMind submodule:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalPilot.git
cd LocalPilot
```

Install the full terminal build:

```sh
# Linux / macOS
./install/install.sh

# Windows PowerShell
./install/install.ps1
```

Check the environment:

```sh
localpilot doctor
```

Create `.localpilot.toml` and point it at a local OpenAI-compatible server:

```toml
[provider]
default = "local"

[providers.local]
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://localhost:8080/v1"
model = "your-local-model"
```

Then start a conversation:

```sh
localpilot chat
```

Or ask one question without tools:

```sh
localpilot ask --model your-local-model "explain this repo's error handling"
```

Hosted APIs use the same configuration model; add `api_key_env` and keep the
credential in the named environment variable. The [provider guide](docs/providers.md)
covers local servers, hosted providers, context windows, authentication, and
reasoning settings.

## Why the harness matters

The model is only one part of a coding agent. In a pinned comparison across 225
Aider-polyglot exercises, the same local model solved **25%** of tasks raw and
**92%** through LocalPilot: a **67-point uplift** from tools, iteration, test
feedback, and recovery. With learning on it reached **93%** — out-solving the
Claude Code harness driving the *same* pinned local model (**88%**); a harness
comparison on one model, not a model claim.

![All four arms on the same local model — raw 25%, LocalPilot harness 92%, Claude Code 88%, LocalPilot with learning 93%](docs/assets/localpilot-four-arm.svg)

> [!NOTE]
> Read the delta, not the absolute score. This is one model and quant; public
> benchmark data can be contamination-prone, and the 600-second timeout counts
> an exercise as unsolved.

## The core workflow

| Command | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `localpilot` / `localpilot chat` | Interactive coding sessions with tools and approvals |
| `localpilot ask` | One prompt, no tools |
| `localpilot print` | A non-interactive agent run for scripts and pipelines |
| `localpilot init` | Project-local configuration and ignore rules |
| `localpilot models` | Models reported by configured OpenAI-compatible servers |
| `localpilot session list` | Find, export, resume, or fork durable sessions |
| `localpilot harness …` | Rule-enforced intake, planning, feature work, and resume |
| `localpilot doctor` | Diagnose providers, credentials, tools, trust, and configuration |

Additional surfaces include MCP tools, `rpc`, `acp`, project knowledge ingestion,
memory search, skill inspection, handoffs, self-review, and redacted session
exports. Run `localpilot --help` for the complete command tree.

### Terminal controls

- `Enter` sends; `Alt+Enter`, `Ctrl+J`, or a trailing `\` inserts a newline.
- `↑` / `↓` recalls project-scoped prompt history.
- `Ctrl-C` cancels the current turn or ingest run.
- `/` opens slash-command completion; `@` mentions a workspace file.
- `/model` changes provider or model without losing the conversation.

The REPL uses the terminal's normal screen buffer, so native scrollback,
selection, and copy/paste continue to work.

## Learns, with your approval

The embedded LocalMind engine distills decisions, fixes, conventions, and tool
recipes from your sessions — **on by default** as of this release, and
**local-only** (it never leaves your machine). Candidates enter a review queue;
only accepted lessons become durable, machine-wide memory and return as context
in future sessions. It is review-gated and redacted, so this is disclosure, not
a data grab — opt out any time with `[learning] enabled = false`.

```text
session ──> candidate lessons ──> your review ──> project memory ──> later sessions
```

In a controlled uplift evaluation, accepted lessons moved a deliberately
headroom-rich task set from **0% to 100%**, and the effect held on a second
model. Nothing is written to durable memory without review.

<summary><strong>Developing LocalPilot</strong></summary>

The local gate mirrors CI:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo check --workspace
cargo build -p localpilot --features tui
cargo clippy -p localpilot --features tui --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo machete
cargo deny check
cargo audit
```

The default binary includes LocalMind-backed learning. The `tui` feature adds
the interactive terminal, and `keychain` adds the Windows credential backend.

## Principles

LocalPilot is an original implementation, not a fork or redistribution of a
vendor CLI. It uses official APIs or local servers, keeps project state local,
and requires explicit approval for risky actions. Windows, Linux, and macOS are
first-class platforms.

## LocalX

LocalPilot is the agent layer in the
[LocalX toolchain](https://c0degeek-dev.github.io/LocalStack/):

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| [LocalBox](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalBox) | Run local models |
| [LocalBench](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalBench) | Find fast, stable settings |
| **LocalPilot** | Code through the agent harness |
| [LocalMind](https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalMind) | Turn reviewed sessions into reusable project memory |
